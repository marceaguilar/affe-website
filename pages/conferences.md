      We are pleased to announce the call for papers for the CUHK Shenzhen/UCSD/Waseda joint conference in field experiments in Accounting and Economics, to be held in Tokyo, Japan, on March 21, 2026.
      
      We welcome manuscripts using field experiments to address important questions in accounting, economics, and finance. Consideration will be given to studies that:
      (1) examine the role of information in shaping decision-making by managers, small business owners and other economic agents;
      (2) use behavioral interventions to reduce inefficiencies in the market;
      or (3) leverage field experiments to test theoretical predictions or calibrate economic models.

      Day 1 (3/20): Welcome Reception
      Day 2 (3/21): Paper presentations (30 mins presentation + 15 mins discussion + 15 mins Q&A)
