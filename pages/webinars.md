Share your early work on experimental design with the AFFE community. We organize webinars to discuss experimental designs together before running experiments, helping you refine your approach and get valuable feedback from peers.



<p style="margin-top: 2rem;">We will also organize periodic methodological webinars on field experiments. Stay updated by registering with the community.</p>
